Snake game

Very simple Snake game in Python. (programming pun unintentional)

The visual style of this game is based on a program I wrote circa 1990.
The game was in assembly language running on a PC clone with a Heracles
Graphics Card (in text mode) and an amber moniter.

The 1990 game was a recreation of a game I played around 1980 on a CP/M
machine.

This game requires the pygame library. (Found elsewhere [google it!])
